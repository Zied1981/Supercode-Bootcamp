          opportunity, meeting the demands and expectations of a modern
          organization.

            It's the early days, you just had a long conversation with two
            friends about a meaningful challenge that you're all passionate
            about and have a potential solution for. You're ready to embark the
            startup journey.

          <p>
            You've bootstrapped and delivered an MVP, and some investors and
            advisors are interested in having a chat with you. As an Open
            Enterprise, you can onboard them seamlessly into your digital
            organization and align them with your success.

          <p>
            You need talented people on-demand across various tasks that your
            full-time workforce can't prioritize at the moment. As an Open
            Enterprise, you can easily fund tasks and have people apply to work
            on them in return for funds or shares.
